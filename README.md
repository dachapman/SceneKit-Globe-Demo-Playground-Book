# SceneKit-Globe-Demo-Playground-Book
This Swift Playground Book guides students through the process of creating a 3-D globe, complete with texture maps, bump maps, and specular reflection.  It uses SceneKit and is in Swift Playground Book format so that students can write the code and see the results immediately on their iPads running Swift Playgrounds.
